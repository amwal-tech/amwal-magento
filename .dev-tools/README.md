## Running unit test locally (through DDEV)

### Prerequisites

2. The Amwal payments plugin installed through composer

### Running the Unit test
To run the test navigate to the root of your project and run the following command:
```shell
ddev exec "vendor/bin/phpunit -c vendor/amwal/payments/.dev-tools/tests/unit/phpunit.xml"
```

## Running integration test locally (through DDEV)

### Prerequisites
1. A local Magento setup running in DDEV
2. The Amwal payments plugin installed through composer

### Copy required files
To ensure the right tests are executed and the configuration is set correctly please copy the following files:

```shell
cp vendor/amwal/payments/.dev-tools/tests/integration/phpunit.xml dev/tests/integration/
```

```shell
cp vendor/amwal/payments/.dev-tools/tests/integration/etc/install-config-mysql.php dev/tests/integration/etc/
```

### Running the Unit test
To run the test navigate to the root of your project and run the following command:
```shell
ddev exec "cd dev/tests/integration && ../../../vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit.xml"

#### Note
Running the integration test will drop your database and re-install Magento. If you would like to preserve your existing data create a separate database for testing and adjust the credentials in [install-config-mysql.php](tests%2Fintegration%2Fetc%2Finstall-config-mysql.php) before copying it to the dev/tests/integration/etc folder.
